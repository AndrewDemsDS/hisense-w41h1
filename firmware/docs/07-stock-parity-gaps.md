# 07 · Stock-parity gap matrix

Single source of truth for "what does the stock A/C do that we don't (yet) mirror." Consolidates
the previously-scattered lists in `05-ha-control-and-native-ui.md`, `01-expose-all-clusters.md`,
`reverse-engineering/docs/{03,05,10}`, and the recon `HIL-RUNBOOK.md`.

Columns: **DEC** = decoded in the driver · **CTRL** = a command builder exists · **EXP** = exposed
to Matter/HA. Capability source = the `0x66/40` ProductType `HisenseFeatures` flags
(`hisense_rs485.h:338-374`, decoder `.cpp:247-282`); the Ghidra-authoritative bit map is
`reverse-engineering/docs/10 §5a` (`handle_producttype_cmd_result @0x9b6f0c4c`).

## Matrix

| Stock feature | DEC | CTRL | EXP | Notes |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|---|
| Power on/off | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | OnOff ep1 |
| Mode (cool/heat/dry/fan/auto) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Thermostat FeatureMap 35 (Heat+Cool+Auto); dry/fan via HA unlock |
| Setpoint | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Occupied Cooling/Heating Setpoint |
| Fan (6 discrete speeds) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | FanControl mode + percent |
| Eco / power-save | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ep3 OnOff "Eco" + mfg `0xFFF1FC00/0x0000` |
| Turbo / boost | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ep5 OnOff "Turbo" + mfg `/0x0002` |
| Mute / quiet | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ep4 OnOff "Quiet" + mfg `/0x0002`; `hisense_build_mute_frame` |
| Sleep profile (4) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ep6 ModeSelect; `hisense_build_sleep_frame` |
| Aux/PTC heat relay | ✅ | – | ✅ | ep7 BooleanState (read-only status) |
| Outdoor + coil temp | ✅ | – | ✅ | ep2 / ep8 TemperatureMeasurement |
| Power (V/I/W) | ✅ | – | ✅ | ElectricalPowerMeasurement (see #16, `power_estimate.h`) |
| Vertical swing on/off | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | FanControl **RockSetting** on ep1, both builds. Shipped under #19. |
| Display / panel on/off | cap only | ✅ | ✅ | OnOff switch on ep9 (write-only, the A/C reports no display state back). Shipped under #19/#33. (Dimmer *level* = `ac_power_display`, still needs new RE.) |
| 8 °C frost-guard heat | ✅ cap | ❌ | ✅ ro | Capability bit `ac_8heat` (byte26 0x80) read as `heat_8c`; `ac_enable_8heat` (byte39 0x04) read as `enable_8heat` when `ext_valid`. No control frame RE'd. `docs/05:79` marks it likely absent on this unit. |
| Purify / ionizer | ✅ cap | ❌ | ✅ ro | `ac_purify` (byte23 0x08) read as `purify`; live `purify_on` (b36 0x20) "bit always 0, feature absent on this unit". No builder. |
| AI / smart | ✅ cap | ❌ | ✅ ro | `ai` (byte28 0x40). Capability only, no control frame. |
| Demand-response | ✅ cap | ❌ | ✅ ro | `demand_resp` 2-bit (byte35). Capability only. |
| Infinite / stepless fan | ✅ cap | ⚠️ | ✅ ro | `infinite_fan` (byte25 0x08); we drive 6 discrete speeds only, not stepless. |
| 8-position louvre aim | ✅ cap | ⚠️ | ✅ ro | `swing_dir_8`/`swing_follow` capability + on/off swing decoded, but no per-position index command. |
| Fresh-air / dew | – | – | – | **No `ac_*` flag exists**: not in the stock feature set, nothing to mirror. |

> `✅ ro` in EXP = the capability flag reads read-only in HA through the Capabilities sensor
> (`Features1`, #82/#39). No control frame is RE'd for any of these, so none is drivable yet.

## Cheap wins: shipped

The two formerly-flagged app-layer gaps (vertical swing → FanControl `RockSetting` on ep1; display
on/off → an OnOff switch on ep9) both shipped under #19, on both AmebaZ2 and ESP32.

Everything else (8 °C heat, purify, dimmer level, AI, demand-response, stepless fan, 8-pos louvre) is
now **read-only exposed** through the `Features1` capability bitmap (#82, #39): each still needs its
*control frame* reverse-engineered before it can be **driven**, and several are argued
physically-absent on this unit (`docs/05:79-80`). Not cheap; defer / track under #52.

## Reading capabilities live

The `HisenseFeatures` set (`hisense_get_features`) is written to the ep1 mfg cluster `0xFFF1FC00` as
attribute `0x0012` (`Features1`, packed bitmap), alongside `CompressorHz` (`0x0010`) and `Faults1`
(`0x0013`). matter-server reads all three live, and the `hisense-unified-ac` HACS integration decodes
them into the Compressor frequency, Capabilities, and Faults entities on nodes 14/35/62 (#82, #39,
closed). The telnet `:2323` `decode` path still works as a secondary read.

## Data-quality bugs found during this review (→ issue #83): RESOLVED

Two field-naming bugs, fixed 2026-07-16/18, both **labels only** (not used for control), so neither
changed behaviour:
- `HisenseFeatures.purify`/`.q_display` were misnamed; renamed to `heat_8c` (byte26 0x80 =
  `ac_8heat`) and `purify` (byte23 0x08 = `ac_purify`) per the Ghidra decode (`docs/10 §5a`). The
  byte reads were always correct.
- `ac_q_display` (byte39 0x40), `ac_enable_8heat` (byte39 0x04), `ac_trans_102_64` (byte38 0x08)
  were undecoded. Added as `q_display`/`enable_8heat`/`trans_102_64`. They live on payload
  `[0x19]`/`[0x1A]`, which stock only sends when the reply is long enough (frame len > 39); gated
  by `HisenseFeatures.ext_valid`, so **a `0` with `ext_valid == false` means "unknown," not
  "absent"**.

**Verified on hardware 2026-07-18** (node 28, fw 1.0.10, `features` on the `:2323` console): the
0x66/40 reply is 45 B, so the extended tier is reachable, and `ac_q_display` reads 1 on this unit,
a capability invisible while the field name held `ac_purify`. `ac_enable_8heat` and
`ac_trans_102_64` read 0. Base-tier flags match the 2026-07-16 capture unchanged (`RE docs/11
§5.1`). Consumers updated: `matter_drivers.cpp` `on_features` logging and the esp32
`diag_console` `features` command, both now print the extended tier or explicitly say UNKNOWN.
